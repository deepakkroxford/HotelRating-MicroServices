eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
server:
  port: 8761



# register-with-eureka: false => Do NOT register this application as a client
# fetch-registry: false Do NOT fetch service registry from another Eureka server

#  Why?
#  You are running only one Eureka server
#  No other Eureka servers exist to fetch data from
#  If you had multiple Eureka servers (cluster) → this would be true
